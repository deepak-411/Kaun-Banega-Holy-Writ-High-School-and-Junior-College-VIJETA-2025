## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep indigo (#4B0082) to convey wisdom, knowledge, and a sense of institution.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0E6FF), near-white but with a hint of the primary hue to maintain connection.
- Accent color: Violet (#8A2BE2), a more vibrant analogous color to highlight interactive elements and important information.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', serif, providing an elegant, intellectual feel appropriate for an academic setting.
- Use simple, clear icons, where needed, to represent options in the quiz and enhance understanding. Icons should be in the accent color.
- The welcome page and quiz pages should use a clean and organized layout. The school logo should be prominently displayed on all pages.
- Employ subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement without being distracting.
